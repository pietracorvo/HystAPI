The example data in this folder is from measurements performed during my physics bachelor.

The material is FeSi3 (iron with 3% silicon), aka 'electrical steel', the standard material for ring cores in trafos.
Four of the five samples where treated with high pressure torison (HPT, 20 rotations at 20GPa), to achieve 
nanocristallisation of the grains, which has a huge impact on the magnetic properties of the material. The HPT 
deformation was done at 77K (under liquid nitrogen) and at 293K (at roomtemperature). Afterwards some samples were 
heat treated at a temperature of 493K (for two hours) to heal out defects from the deformation process.

The five samples are:
- FeSi3 annealed (not HPT deformed)
- FeSi3, HPT at 293K, not heat treated
- FeSi3, HPT at 293K, heat treated 2h at 493K
- FeSi3, HPT at 77K, not heat treated
- FeSi3, HPT at 77K, heat treated 2h at 493K
